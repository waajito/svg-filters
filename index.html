            <H2> How I made mobile game in 7 days and published it on the play store</H2>

            <p>Disclaimer: I have been developing games for almost a decade now. <br /> So this is my personal
                experience
                that I
                wanted to share and it’s not a guide for beginners.</p>

            <p>
                It started out as a new year resolution which got pushed around for months and finally I got time to do
                it.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 1</h3>

            <p> Figuring out what kind of game to make. some of the requirements are it needs to be a hyper-casual game.
                something that can be played while holding the phone with a single hand. preferably tap-based game.
            </p>
            <p> Coming to the tools we’ll be using unity is used for development and Figma for the design and some other
                assets
                for music and so on.</p>

            <h3>Day 2</h3>

            <p> So now that we’ve gotten the game mechanics figured out. we’ll have to start working on the design. I’ll
                be
                opening figma and creating the game’s UI elements, sprites and other necessary assets. I’m going to make
                the
                UI
                elements as simple as possible but still look aesthetically pleasing. It took me a while to get the
                design
                right, but I finally found a design that I was satisfied with.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 3</h3>

            <p>I start coding the game mechanics and implementing the UI. I made sure to keep the code clean and modular
                so
                that it can easily be modified or added to in the future. I spent most of the day working on the code,
                trying to
                make sure that everything was working correctly. I ran into a few issues, but I was able to fix them
                fairly
                quickly.</p>

            <h3>Day 4</h3>

            <p> I continued working on the code, trying to add more features to the game. I also started working on the
                sound
                effects and music for the game. I wanted the game to be engaging, so I spent a lot of time trying to
                find
                the
                right sounds and music for the game.</p>

            <h3>Day 5</h3>

            <p>I continued working on the sound effects and music for the game. I also made some changes to the game
                mechanics,
                trying to make the game more fun and engaging. I spent most of the day working on the game, trying to
                get
                everything just right.</p>

            <h3>Day 6</h3>

            <p>
                I spent the day testing the game, trying to find any bugs or issues that needed to be fixed. I also
                continued
                working on the sound effects and music for the game. I wanted the game to be perfect, so I spent a lot
                of
                time
                testing and tweaking everything.
            </p>

            <h3>Day 7</h3>
            <p>
                The final day. I test the game and fix any bugs or issues that I come across. Once I’m satisfied with
                the
                game,
                I sign up for a Google Play Developer account and publish the game on the Play Store. It was a long,
                tiring
                week, but I was finally able to publish my game on the Play Store. I was really proud of what I had
                accomplished, and I couldn't wait for people to play my game.

                And that’s how I made a mobile game in just 7 days and published it on the Play Store!
